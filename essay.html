      <h2>📝 Sample Essay 1 – Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology (≈180 words)</h2>
      <p>
        Technology has become an essential part of modern life. In my opinion,
        technology has both advantages and disadvantages for individuals and society.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the main advantages of technology is communication. As technology
        develops, people can communicate easily with others from different parts
        of the world. If people use technology effectively, they can save time and
        access information quickly. Another advantage is education because students
        can improve their knowledge by using online resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, technology also has some disadvantages. People may become addicted
        to their phones and computers, so they may spend less time with their families.
        In addition, if children use technology too much, they may face health problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, technology is very useful in daily life, but it should be used
        carefully and responsibly.

      <h2>📝 Sample Essay 2 – Causes and Effects of Stress (≈180 words)</h2>
      <p>
        Stress is a common problem in modern life, especially among students and
        employees. There are several causes of stress, and it has serious effects
        on people’s lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the main causes of stress is work and education. As competition
        increases, people feel more pressure to be successful. If students do not
        manage their time properly, they may feel stressed before exams. Another
        cause is financial problems because money plays an important role in daily life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stress can have negative effects on health. People may feel tired and unhappy,
        and they may have difficulty concentrating. As a result, stress can reduce
        productivity and damage relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, people should learn how to manage stress in order to live a healthier
        and more balanced life.
