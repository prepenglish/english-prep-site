                <h2>Sample Essay 1 – Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology</h2>

                <p>
                    Technology has become an essential part of modern life. In my opinion,
                    technology has both advantages and disadvantages for individuals and society.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the main advantages of technology is communication. As technology develops,
                    people can communicate easily with others from different parts of the world.
                    If people use technology effectively, they can save time and access information quickly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, technology also has some disadvantages. People may become addicted to their
                    phones and computers, so they may spend less time with their families.
                    In addition, if children use technology too much, they may face health problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result, technology is very useful in daily life, but it should be used
                    carefully and responsibly.

                <h2>Sample Essay 2 – Causes and Effects of Stress</h2>

                <p>
                    Stress is a common problem in modern life. There are several causes of stress,
                    especially in education and work life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the main causes of stress is pressure. As competition increases,
                    people feel more stress to be successful. If students do not manage their time well,
                    they may feel anxious before exams.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stress has many negative effects on people. It can cause health problems such as
                    headaches and sleep issues. Therefore, people should learn how to control stress.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, stress is a serious problem, but if people take action early,
                    its effects can be reduced.
